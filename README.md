# C# Development Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of C# and .NET projects! This portfolio showcases various programming concepts including object-oriented principles, method design, operator overloading, and full-stack web development with ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.

## Featured Projects

### 1. ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework
- **Overview**: This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic web application using ASP.NET MVC in combination with Entity Framework for database access. CRUD operations, routing, and model binding are all covered.
- **Key Concepts**: ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, LINQ, Razor Views.
- **Repository**: [ASP.NET MVC Entity Framework](https://github.com/KaoutarAbquelazz/ASP.NET-MVC-Entity-Framework)

---

### 2. Polymorphism and Interface Usage
- **Overview**: A concise project illustrating polymorphism via interfaces and base classes. It includes examples where multiple classes inherit from a parent and implement common behavior in different ways.
- **Key Concepts**: Inheritance, Interfaces, Polymorphism.
- **Repository**: [Polymorphism Assignment Submission](https://github.com/KaoutarAbquelazz/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission)

### 3. Operator Overloading and Comparison
- **Overview**: This C# project customizes the behavior of `==` and `!=` for comparing objects, along with proper implementation of `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` to maintain consistency.
- **Key Concepts**: Operator Overloading, Object Comparison, Equality Methods.
- **Repository**: [Operators Assignment Submission](https://github.com/KaoutarAbquelazz/Operators-Assignment-Submission)

### 4. Structuring Code with Methods and Classes
- **Overview**: Focused on writing clean, modular code using methods and class architecture. It includes examples of both static and instance methods.
- **Key Concepts**: Method Design, Static vs. Instance Methods, Encapsulation.
- **Repository**: [Method Class Assignment Submission](https://github.com/KaoutarAbquelazz/Method-Class-Assignment-Submission)

### 5. Capstone Portfolio Project
- **Overview**: This final assignment combines multiple C# concepts into a cohesive application. It is designed to demonstrate overall understanding and practical implementation of course material.
- **Key Concepts**: Project Integration, Full Application Flow, C# Fundamentals.
- **Repository**: [Final Assignment Submission](https://github.com/KaoutarAbquelazz/Final-Assignment-Submission)
